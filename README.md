## Image Handling in Shopify

### **Uploading Images**
- Do **not** upload images into the `assets` folder.
- Instead, upload them to **Content > Files** on the main website.

### **Using Uploaded Images**
Once an image is uploaded to **Files**, reference it in your theme using the `file_url` filter:
```liquid
<img src="{{ 'example-image.jpg' | file_url }}" alt="Example Image">
```

## Linking CSS in Shopify
To apply custom styles, you must link your CSS in `theme.liquid`:
1. Open `theme.liquid`
2. Press `Ctrl + F` and search for "stylesheet"
3. Add your CSS link below existing stylesheets:
   ```liquid
   {{ 'section-cost-comparison.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}
   ```

## Rendering Sections in Shopify Liquid vs JSON

### **1. Rendering Sections in Liquid Files**
In Shopify, sections are rendered within Liquid templates using the `{% section %}` tag:

#### Example in Liquid:
If you have a section called `hero-banner.liquid` in the `sections` directory, include it in a template like this:
```liquid
{% section 'hero-banner' %}
```

### **2. Rendering Sections in JSON Files**
Shopify's Online Store 2.0 uses JSON templates for layout definitions, where sections are defined within the `sections` array.

#### Example in JSON (index.json):
```json
{
  "sections": {
    "hero-banner": {
      "type": "hero-banner",
      "settings": {
        "heading": "Welcome to our Store!"
      }
    }
  },
  "order": ["hero-banner"]
}
```

### **Summary**
- **Liquid Rendering**: Uses `{% section 'section-name' %}` to directly render sections within a template.
- **JSON Rendering**: Sections are defined in the JSON file with the `sections` key, and the `order` key controls their layout sequence.
- **Key Difference**: Liquid renders sections immediately in templates, while JSON defines layout order for Shopifyâ€™s Online Store 2.0.
